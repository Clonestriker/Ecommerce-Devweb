                I cant beat the shit out of you without getting any closer. Also,

                Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
                I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
                It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
                so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence 
                the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge
                of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared
                about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway
                to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became
                so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing
                his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
                Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,
                then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
                He could save others from death, but not himself.
